"""
In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers,
usually positive integers, is called a magic square if
the sums of the numbers in each row, each column,
and both main diagonals are the same.

Magic Number = n(n^2+1)/2......n=3,5,7.......

Position of 1 is always in the middle row and last column (n/2,n-1)

Position of 2 == (p-1,q+1)
